          <p>
            Sentry is an internal attendance tool. It captures a facial image, converts it to a numeric
            encoding, and compares it against an enrolled roster to mark students present. It is intended
            for use by authorized teachers and staff within this institution only.

        <section>
          <h3 style={{ color: 'var(--ink)', marginBottom: 6 }}>2. Consent &amp; data use</h3>
          <p>
            Enrolling a student's photo requires appropriate consent under your institution's policy.
            Photos and derived face encodings are stored locally and used solely to compute attendance.
            They are not sent to any third party.
          </p>

          <h3 style={{ color: 'var(--ink)', marginBottom: 6 }}>3. Manual overrides</h3>
          <p>
            Automated recognition can misfire — lighting, angle, or camera quality all affect accuracy.
            Teacher and developer accounts may manually toggle a record between Present and Absent; this
            action is final unless changed again by an authorized account.

            <strong style={{ color: 'var(--ink)' }}>Teacher</strong> accounts may view logs, override
            attendance, and rename roster entries. <strong style={{ color: 'var(--ink)' }}>Developer</strong>{' '}
            accounts additionally have full access to add, rename, and permanently delete roster entries
            and attendance records.

        <section>
          <h3 style={{ color: 'var(--ink)', marginBottom: 6 }}>5. No warranty</h3>
          <p>
            Sentry is provided as-is for internal use. It is not a certified biometric security product and
            should not be relied on as the sole means of identity verification for safety-critical
            decisions.
